# A Form of Resistance: Manipulating Web Forms

We all use forms every day. While they vary a great deal, we know how they usually work, and we adjust our behaviors to suit each website. But when a form doesn't work the way we expect, it can cause us confusion, frustration, or helplessness. In the worst cases, forms can deny us our own lived identities: our genders, our titles, or our names.

What can we do? Well, sometimes we have options beyond the ones the form gives us. In this workshop, I will discuss using browsers’ developer tools to get a look at how web forms are constructed. I’ll demonstrate techniques for modifying forms, inviting participants to try out these techniques on forms custom-made for this workshop.

You only need to know [what HTML markup looks like](https://gist.github.com/amclark42/ace2c44b1c987d91fb5a79eefad34662). No coding experience is necessary, only an openness to discussing ethical web-citizenry, data collection, and/or web design.
